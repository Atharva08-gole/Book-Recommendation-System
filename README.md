A simple yet effective Book Recommendation System built with Flask, Pandas, and Pickle. This project recommends similar books based on user input using a content-based filtering approach.# Book-Recommendation-System

📂 Project Structure

🧠 How It Works
The system loads precomputed data:
popular.pkl contains top-rated books with metadata.
pt.pkl is a pivot table of books and user ratings.
books.pkl contains detailed metadata of all books.
similarity_scores.pkl holds similarity values between books.
A user inputs a book title.
The system finds similar books using the similarity score matrix.
Recommended books (title, author, image) are displayed on the result page.
